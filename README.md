I grew up in Yangling, a small town in Shaanxi, near by Xi'an. I also finished my middle school there. After that, I went to The Middle School Attached To Northwestern Polytechnical University and finished my high school. Now I'm a undergraduate student at School of Physics and Astronomy in Sun Yat-sen University.

I love playing video games, espescially on Nintendo Switch. [Here](xxx-yyy.com) are some of my comments on games I palyed. Readin novel is also a great leisure activity for me.
